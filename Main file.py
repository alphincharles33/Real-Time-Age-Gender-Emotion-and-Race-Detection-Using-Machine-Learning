# Enhanced Jarvis Voice Assistant
# This code is a voice-activated AI chatbot that can perform various tasks like playing 
# music, searching the web, managing tasks, and more.
# It uses libraries like pyttsx3 for text-to-speech, speech_recognition for voice commands,
#  and webbrowser for opening websites.

# Import necessary libraries
# Ensure you have the required libraries installed:
# pip install pyttsx3 speech_recognition plyer pyautogui wikipedia pywhatkit openai
# Also, ensure you have the OpenAI API key set up in user_config
